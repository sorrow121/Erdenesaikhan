# 🌿 Solo Dev Studio — Crafted by One, Built for All

Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm a solo developer who believes in clean code, bold ideas, and the magic of building things from scratch. This site is my digital workshop — a place where experiments live, projects breathe, and curiosity thrives.

## 🎨 Theme & Vibe

This site is designed with a **dark green & light brown** palette — earthy, grounded, and quietly powerful. Think forest at dusk meets vintage leather journal. It’s minimal, but not boring. Calm, but not sleepy.

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here

- **Projects**: Personal builds, open-source tools, and the occasional weird idea that somehow works.
- **Blog**: Dev thoughts, code breakdowns, and lessons learned the hard way.
- **About Me**: A peek into the mind behind the keyboard.
- **Contact**: Say hi, suggest a collab, or just drop a meme.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

Built with:
- HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript
- Frameworks: [Insert your stack here, e.g., React, Vue, Svelte]
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
